    "title": "Was the NFC North the most cursed conference in the 2022 season?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "NFC North fans have been let down time after time watching their team throughout the entire 2022 season. The NFC North consists of the Green Bay Packers, Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears, and Minnesota Vikings. These teams had high hopes for 2022; however, they continuously finish in an unwanted standing.\nThe last time a team in the NFC North played in the Super Bowl was in 2011 with Green Bay winning. The conference ranks among the last in the league for Super Bowl appearances. In fact, the Lions have never even won a NFC North title. The last time they won a title was in 1993, when the conference was the NFC Central.\nThe NFC North has been consistent on offense, but their defense have been questionable. Fans could see a different dynamic between the conference throughout the entire 2022 season, for better and for worse.\nThis begs the question: Was the NFC North the most cursed conference in the 2022 season?\nLet’s take a look at the numbers.\nTo start, the chart will showcase the total takeaways for each NFL team throughout the season. The more takeaways, the better. Where do the NFC North defenses rank among the rest of the league?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnfl &lt;- read_csv(\"defense.csv\")\n\nturnovers &lt;- nfl |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Giveaways = sum(OffInt,Fum),\n    Takeaways = sum(TO))\n\ngb &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Green Bay Packers\")\n\nmn &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nch &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Bears\")\n\ndt &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Detroit Lions\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=turnovers,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, Takeaways), x=Takeaways),\n    horizontal = TRUE\n    ) +\n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=gb,\n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways),\n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=dt,\n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways),\n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    color = \"lightblue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=mn,\n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways),\n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    color = \"purple\"\n  ) +\n  geom_lollipop(\n    data=ch,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, Takeaways), x=Takeaways),\n    horizontal = TRUE,\n    color = \"orange\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The NFC North's 2022 Defense: Middle of the Pack\",\n    subtitle = \"Vikings owned the conference with the best defense.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Lauren Aleknavicius \",\n    y= \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face =\"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s look at how the offense compares in rushing and passing yards. The Lions, surprisingly, finished 5th in the league. Thus, the Lions were at the top compared to the rest of the NFC North in total yards. The Vikings were closest in competition to the Lions finishing 7th overall.\nSo, is the NFC North actually a force to be reckoned with on offense? Meaning, does this conference have the worst luck in history?\n\n\nCode\nyds &lt;- read_csv(\"offense.csv\")\n\nnorth &lt;- yds |&gt;\n  select(\n    Team, Conf, PassYds, RushYds\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"NFC North\")\n\ndtwaffle &lt;- c(\"Rushing\"=2179, \"Passing\"=4281)\nchwaffle &lt;- c(\"Rushing\"=3014, \"Passing\"=2219, 1227)\ngbwaffle &lt;- c(\"Rushing\"=2113, \"Passing\"=3632, 715)\nmnwaffle &lt;- c(\"Rushing\"=1661, \"Passing\"=4484, 315)\niron(\nwaffle(\n  dtwaffle/20,\n  rows=10,\n  xlab= \"1 square = 20 yards\",\n  colors = c(\"lightgrey\", \"lightblue\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Do Not Underestimate the 2022\n    NFC North Offenses\",\n    subtitle = \"Lions finish 5th in the league in total yards.\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face =\"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) + \n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Detroit Lions\")),\n\nwaffle(\n  mnwaffle/20,\n  rows=10,\n  xlab= \"1 square = 20 yards\",\n  colors = c(\"yellow\", \"purple\", \"white\")\n  ) + \n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Minnesota Vikings\")),\n\nwaffle(\n  mnwaffle/20,\n  rows=10,\n  xlab= \"1 square = 20 yards\",\n  colors = c(\"darkgreen\", \"yellow\", \"white\")\n) + \n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Green Bay Packers\")),\n\nwaffle (\n chwaffle/20,\n  rows = 10, \n  xlab= \"1 square = 20 yards\",\n  colors = c(\"orange\", \"navy\", \"white\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Lauren Aleknavicius\"\n  ) + \n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Chicago Bears\"))\n) +\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, we will look at the total points scored versus allowed by each team in the conference compared to the rest of the league. The Bears are ultimately the worst team on defense. They allowed the most points scored. On the other hand, the rest of the defense made stops.\nAgain, the Lions ranked among the highest in points scored; however, they also have some of the most points allowed. Is this why they have never won a NFC North title?\n\n\nCode\ntotals &lt;- read_csv(\"games.csv\")\n\ngbtd &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Green Bay Packers\")\n\nmntd &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nchtd &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Bears\")\n\ndttd &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Detroit Lions\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=totals,\n    aes(x=PF, y=PA)) +\n  geom_point(data=dttd, aes(x=PF, y=PA), color=\"lightblue\", ) +\n  geom_point(data=chtd, aes(x=PF, y=PA), color=\"orange\")  +\n  geom_point(data=gbtd, aes(x=PF, y=PA), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_point(data=mntd, aes(x=PF, y=PA), color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=dttd, aes(x=PF, y=PA, label=\"Detriot Lions\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=chtd, aes(x=PF, y=PA, label=\"Chicago Bears\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=gbtd, aes(x=PF, y=PA, label=\"Green Bay Packers\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=mntd, aes(x=PF, y=PA, label=\"Minnesota Vikings\"), size=3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"2022 NFC North: Offense vs Defense Scoring\",\n    subtitle = \"Bears ranked first with the most points allowed.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Lauren Aleknavicius \",\n    x= \"Points Scored\",\n    y= \"Points Allowed\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face =\"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, every NFC North team played surprisingly well, but just does not compare to the other teams in the league. This confirms that the conference was the most cursed throughout 2022. There is high hopes for the 2023 season.\nThe NFC North has had a drastic change within quarterbacks in 2023; therefore, will the teams outperform compared to last year or will they finish even worse? This question is keeping fans on their toes.\nWhere does the conference finish this year? Will the Lions continue to lead the conference and win their first NFC North title? Signs are pointing in their direction."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs have appeared in three of the last four Super Bowls. They came away as champions in 2020 and 2023. Although the 2023-2024 regular season is not yet complete, teams are nearing the end of their games. The data is complete through week 12 this season. Currently, the Chiefs are 8-3. This makes them first in their division, the AFC West. The other leaders in the AFC are the Miami Dolphins, Baltimore Ravens, and Jacksonville Jaguars.\nThus, are the Kansas City Chiefs on track to win another Super Bowl in 2024?\nThe Chiefs are hoping to continue their success into the post season. Unless something drastic happens within the league, the Chiefs will be making their eighth consecutive post season appearance. Much of their success can be contributed to the defense this season. How does the Chiefs defense compare to the other top teams in the AFC?\nThe Chiefs defense has been keeping the Chiefs on top; however, when comparing rushing and passing yards to the other top teams in the AFC the Chiefs are just average. As of week 12, they were first at stopping passing yards, but last in allowing the most rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nafc &lt;- read_csv(\"defense.csv\")\n\nafc |&gt;\n  select(\n    Team, YdsPass, YdsRush\n  ) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n  cols=starts_with(\"Yds\"),\n  names_to=\"Type\",\n  values_to=\"Yards\") -&gt; afcwide \n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(\n    data=afcwide,\n    aes(x=reorder(Team, Yards),\n        weight=Yards, fill= Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"orangered1\", \"orange2\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  \n    labs(\n    title = \"Chiefs Dominate Defensively, Rank 3rd Overall in Yards Per Play.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Jaguars are out for revenge allowing less than 1,000 rushing yards by week 12.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Lauren Aleknavicius\",\n    y= \"Defensive Yards Per Play\",\n    x=\"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face =\"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chiefs offense has been yet to have solid starting game. They have been seeming to pick up speed later this season. Patrick Mahomes has started every game this season at quarterback, unlike the previous season due to an injury. Mahomes is considered one of the best quarterbacks in the league.\nAlthough the AFC West is relatively good at passing this season, there are several teams in the hunt that are not. The Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Philadelphia Eagles, and San Francisco 49ers have all appeared in the Super Bowl within the past four seasons. Each team has been a force to be reckon with. On the other hand, The New York Jets and Cleveland Browns have been consistently the worst on offense. Let’s look at passing completion by various teams.\nCompleted passes and total pass attempts compile together to create a completion percentage.

Their offense is once again unstoppable, but something is different this year. The Chiefs defense is finally stepping up to the plate. With such dominate defense, the Chiefs are in a great position for playing in their second straight Super Bowl.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will be a force to be reckon with in the post season in hopes of making another Super Bowl appearance in 2024."

Additionally, I am obtaining a minor in communication studies. Throughout my time in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, I have aquaired skills in time-management, communication, and more importantly team-work. In addition to my academics, I am involved with athletics on campus that has led to various leadership positions with a plethora of individuals. I will be graduating early in December of 2024; therefore, I am eager to get my foot in the door within the sports industry. I am looking to bring my passion for sports, relationship building, and learning into a workplace that has exponential room for growth.\nThis blog will showcase my project in SPMC350. Throughout the course, I have learned so much about RStudio. I look forward to presenting my findings in this blog."

    "text": "Hi. My name is Lauren. I am a junior from Green Bay, Wisconsin at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am a double major in sports media and communications and advertising and public relations. Additionally, I am obtaining a minor in communication studies. Throughout my time in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, I have acquired skills in time-management, communication, and more importantly team-work.\nIn addition to my academics, I am involved with athletics on campus that has led to various leadership positions with a plethora of individuals. I attend each practice and competition with the women’s gymnastics team as their student manager. I love being able to get in the gym everyday, while working with some of the best athletes and coaches in the NCAA. Although I have a love for gymnastics, my ultimate goal is to work in the National Football League. Football has been in my life from a young age. Being from Green Bay, I have grown up around football and I cannot wait to be in a workplace where football is the main focus.\nI will be graduating early in December of 2024; therefore, I am eager to get my foot in the door within the sports industry. I am looking to bring my passion for sports, relationship building, and learning into a workplace that has exponential room for growth.\nThis blog will showcase my project in SPMC350: Sports Data Analysis and Visualization. Throughout the course, I have learned so much about RStudio. I look forward to presenting my findings in this blog."
